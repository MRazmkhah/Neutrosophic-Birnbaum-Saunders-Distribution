# R Scripts for Neutrosophic Birnbaum-Saunders Distribution (NBSD)

This repository contains R scripts accompanying the paper *"Neutrosophic Birnbaum-Saunders Distribution with Applications."* The scripts are organized by their purpose and correspond to the sections in the paper.

## File Descriptions and Order of Execution

1. **[pdf-plot.R](pdf-plot.R)**  
   - Plots the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the NBSD.

2. **[Cdf-plot.R](Cdf-plot.R)**  
   - Plots the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the NBSD.

3. **[Hazard-plot.R](Hazard-plot.R)**  
   - Plots the Hazard Function of the NBSD.

4. **[Simulation.R](Simulation.R)**  
   - Simulates data for the neutrosophic Birnbaum-Saunders distribution (NBSD).

5. **[Properties of NBS.R](Properties%20of%20NBS.R)**  
   - Examines statistical properties of the NBSD.

6. **[Application 1.R](Application%201.R)**  
   - First application of the NBSD to pseudo neutrosophic dataset.

7. **[Application 2 NBSD.R](Application%202%20NBSD.R)**  
   - Second application - environmental dataset - part 1 - NBSD.

8. **[Application 2 NGamma.R](Application%202%20NGamma.R)**  
   - Second application - environmental dataset - part 2 - neutrosophic Gamma distribution.

9. **[Application 2 NLN.R](Application%202%20NLN.R)**  
   - Second application - environmental dataset - part 3 - neutrosophic log-normal distribution.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Ensure you have the required R packages installed for proper execution. For questions or clarifications, please contact the author.
